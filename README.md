# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using various machine learning algorithms. Churn, the loss of customers, significantly impacts business revenue. By analyzing customer demographics, services, and account data, we built predictive models that help identify customers at risk of leaving.

Key steps include:

1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
2. Handling class imbalance using SMOTE.
3. Model building with Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and Naive Bayes.
4. Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

The project provides actionable insights for customer retention and demonstrates how data-driven solutions can support business decisions.
